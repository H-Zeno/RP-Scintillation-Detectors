# RP-Scintillation-Detectors
This directory contains the measurement data and analysis for research about the workings of scintillation detectors ("A comparison of NaI(Tl) and LaBr3(Ce) scintillation detectors with respective geometry differences."). The research is part of the course "Research Practicum" from the Delft University of Technology. 

All measurement data is contained in two spreadsheets. The data analysis was performed in a Python lab journal, alternating between coding and text descriptions. The measurement data and lab journal are open source available via this GitHub directory. The lab journal can also be accessed via the following URL: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nvZJXq2g545gIRXNmGi-jrc8Qy_1q-26?usp=sharing 

The files NaI(Tl)_BG.txt and LaBr3(Ce)_BG.txt contain exported background gamma spectra.
